They earn $75,000 annually, have $15,000 in savings, $25,000 in a 401k, and want to retire at 65. They are risk-averse but understand the need for some growth. Create a comprehensive retirement planning strategy that includes investment allocation, savings goals, tax considerations, and milestone checkpoints. Explain your reasoning for each recommendation and provide specific actionable steps they can take in the next 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years. Also discuss potential risks and how to mitigate them, including market volatility, inflation, healthcare costs, and changes in employment. Finally, explain how they should adjust their strategy as they approach retirement age.",
